# Description
The original idea of this software is to ease the life of the admins to monitor their pc's healths. The admin should install the pc application on on the pcs he wants to monitor and he/she can monitor them through the website.
The pc application is developed using .NET Core 5, having a pc configuration app using Java Swing.
The website is developed using React.JS.
# How it works
U need to download the pc app on every PC and configure them (more details of how to configure the pc app on the [website](https://psee.netlify.app/)). Then, the pcs will send their diagnostic data to the admin's account in the website which visualizes them.
